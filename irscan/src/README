These are the sources for the small irscan tool 
it is written in D so you'll have to install the
D compiler and libraries to be able to compile it.

You can get them here: 
http://www.digitalmars.com/d/

for linux and windows

and here:
http://gdcmac.sourceforge.net/

for Mac OS X.

to compile irscan type
dmd irscan.d getopt.d bio/*.d or
gdmd irscan.d getopt.d bio/*.d (Mac)

there's no guarantee that this software will
give you sensible results on all sequences you
provide (it has worked with all seqs i fed in
so far, though). Input sequences may be in 
FASTA, GenBank or plain sequence format.

enjoy.
