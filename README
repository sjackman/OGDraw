Installation
============

To install the package, on a command line type:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
The package uses quite some public modules so you might have to install
them either using the CPAN shell or by downloading them manually.

irscan
======

In addition to the perl modules, the 'findIRborders' method of 
GeneMap::Plastome requires the irscan tool to be installed in your 
path. The package contains compiled binaries for linux_x86, Mac OS X (PPC)
and Windows. If you are running a different OS / architecture you'll have
to compile the source code on your machine.
